####Screen Valley is a new hope.

Idea is simple: `Fragments` in Android â€” good idea, bad implementation.
`ScreenValley` is a similar concept as `Fragments`, but more **solid**, **simple** and **obvious**.

Current state: work in progress, when 0.1 will be finished I'll invite several developers for code review and API desing improvements, then we'll ship 1.0.
